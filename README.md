# üèÅ Grid Sprint

**Grid Sprint** is an interactive algorithm visualizer that lets you explore and compare popular pathfinding algorithms like **A\***, **Dijkstra's**, and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in real-time.

Live Demo: https://grid-sprint.vercel.app/

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch how A*, Dijkstra‚Äôs, and BFS traverse the grid to find the shortest path.
- **Interactive Grid**: Set start/end points, add obstacles, and customize the environment.
- **Instant Feedback**: Visualize how different algorithms behave under the same conditions.
- **No Setup Needed**: Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

## Usage

1. **Set Start and End Points:** Click cells to set green (start) and red (end) points.
2. **Add Obstacles:** Click cells to add obstacles for algorithms to navigate.
3. **Select Algorithm:** Choose A*, Dijkstra's, or BFS from the dropdown.
4. **Visualize Pathfinding:** Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm find the shortest path.
5. **Reset Grid:** Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid.
